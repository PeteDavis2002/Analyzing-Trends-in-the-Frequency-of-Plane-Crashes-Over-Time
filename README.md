# Analyzing-Trends-in-the-Frequency-of-Plane-Crashes-Over-Time
Repository for my project assessing trends and changes in frequency of plane crashes between 1918 and 2022.

This is the repo for my ITEC 4220 Advanced Analytics project in which I assess trends in air crashes and their associated fatalities over time. To start, I 
downloaded the historical plane crash data set as PlaneCrashes.csv from Kaggle at the url https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data. 
With this project, I hope to evaluate the relative safety of air travel across different eras of aviation.
